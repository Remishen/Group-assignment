# Group Assignment

### Introduction of our activity: 
Pinch your nose and turn yourself 15 times. Then immediately use app called "AnaHertz" to record the information of our balanced capacity in 10 seconds. The app could automatically set the time so the data collected is accurate. The variable xGyro measures the stability of our hand holding the phone. It is concrete, continuous and countable. And some members of the group are experts and some are novices.

### Note:
Our groups' data, code, visualizations and conclusions are all combined and shown in Report.Rmd.
