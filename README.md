# Group Assignment

### Introduction of our activity: 
Pinch your nose and turn yourself 15 times. Then immediately use app called "AnaHertz" to record the information of our balanced capacity in 10 seconds. The app could automatically set the time so the data collected is accurate. The variable xGyro measures the stability of our hand holding the phone. It is concrete, continuous and countable. And some members of the group are experts and some are novices.

### Data:
Five csv files named by group member's fist name are raw data from app AnaHertz.
Questions.csv contains five questions on a five point Likert scale.

These questions are:
1. Your confidence in balancing ability.
2. How difficult do you think of this activity?
3. Times of having tried the activity in the past five years.
4. To what extent does your life relate to balancing ability.
5. Frequency of feeling dazzling.

### Note:
Our group's data, code, visualizations and conclusions are all combined and shown in Report.Rmd.
